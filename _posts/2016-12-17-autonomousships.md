Shipping remains a vast industry that humanity always rely on. Around 90% of the world trade is
carried by ships. Ship manufacturers and owners are continuously focusing on new ways to improve the efficiency and safety of large vessels.

### Autonomous ships

Currently, Rolls-Royce with Advanced Autonomous Waterborne Applications Initiative (AAWA) published a whitepaper at the Autonomous Ship Technology Symposium 2016 in Amsterdam. The whitepaper explores how the remote and autonomous ships will become reality.

Ship will be able to log and monitor its own health and its condition will be supervised
remotely. Researchers are foncusing on the development of a set of electronic senses that will inform an electronic brain and allow the vessel to navigate safely and avoid collision. The ship
will be equiped with a set of sensors such as infrared cameras, radars, high definition cameras that will look in 360 degrees around the ship. By fusing mutiple sensor inputs a vessel or its remote operators will have  an accurate perspective on the vesselâ€™s surroundings at all times and in all conditions.

Rolls-Royce envisages a remotely operated local vessel being in operation by 2020.
