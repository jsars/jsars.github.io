According to the World Health Organization, in 2050, infections caused by ultra-resistant bacteria will be the world's leading cause of death.  Antibiotics destroy everything in their path, good bacteria and bad, which unbalances the human microbiota and can lead to the spawning of new germs.

### Eligobiotic

<a href="http://eligo-bioscience.com/" target="\_blank">Eligo Bioscience</a>, has come up with an alternative treatment: a biological robot, made out of DNA and proteins. Their intelligent biotic is capable of identifying bacteria that need to be killed, including those that are resistant to antibiotics. This new biotic called 'eligobiotique' has already been tested successfully on mice that carried an ultra-resistant version of staphylococcus aureus, one of the deadliest bacteria in the world. Eligobiotiques could also be 'reprogrammed' to get rid of the bacteria responsible for bowel inflammation and eradicate Crohn's disease or acne. If this product turns out to be efficient, it could be used on any pathology linked to the microbiota, such as diabetes and certain types of cancer.
