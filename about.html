## About

Hi there! My name is Ioannis and I come from the beautiful city of Piraeus, Athens, Greece. I received my Diploma in Electronic & Computer Engineering at the <a href="http://www.tuc.gr/5397.html">Technical University of Crete (TUC)</a> in Chania in 2010 and my M.Sc degree in Networked Computer Systems at the "Grande École" <a href="http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/">Télécom ParisTech (ENST)</a> in Paris in 2013. Currently I am living in Paris and my interests lie in the field of software engineering and telecommunications. This is my personal web site.
